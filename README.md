ATMI (Asynchronous Task and Memory Interface)
=============================================

Asynchronous Task and Memory Interface, or ATMI, is a runtime framework and declarative programming model for heterogeneous
CPU-GPU systems. It provides a consistent API to create task graphs on CPUs and GPUs (integrated and discrete). ATMI is a declarative
programming model, where the high-level task configurations can be simply described by using a few predefined C-style structures before launching the tasks.
The task description includes specifying its granularity, dependencies to other tasks, data requirements and so on. The ATMI runtime, based on the overall task
graph and individual task configurations, will perform task scheduling and memory management that is optimal for the underlying platform. ATMI provides a rich and flexible
user interface so that the end user can relinquish scheduling to the runtime (default behavior) or take full control of scheduling and
mapping, if desired. The target audience for ATMI is application programmers or middleware developers for high-level languages.

## ATMI (v0.5) Feature List
- ATMI-RT: host runtime library to manage tasks
- ATMI-DEVRT: device runtime library for managing task enqueue from the GPU to both the CPU and other GPUs in the system
- ATMI-C (experimental): C language extension for declaring tasks (works only with GCC)
- A comprehensive machine model for CPUs, integrated GPU (APU) and discrete GPU systems.
- Consistent task management API for CPU tasks and GPU tasks
    - GPU kernel language: CL (more kernel language support to come in the future)
    - CPU tasks: support for multi-dimensional task grids (similar to GPU tasks)
- Task dependencies
- Task groups
- Recursive tasks (tasks creating other tasks)
- Efficient resource management
    - Signaling among dependent tasks
    - Kernel argument memory regions
    - Reuse of task handles
- Data movement API (synchronous and asynchronous options)
    - Asynchronous data movement is treated as an ATMI task in the task graph
- Interoperability with HSA/ROCm: Map between ATMI handles and ROCm data structures for expert programmers
- Supported platforms: all devices that are supported by [ROCm](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm) are supported by ATMI
- Supported runtime: ROCm v1.7+

## Compilation and Runtime Workflow
