## ATMI v0.3
- ATMI-RT: runtime library to manage tasks
- ATMI-C: language extension for declaring tasks
- A  comprehensive machine model for CPUs, integrated GPU (APU) and discrete GPU (dGPU) systems.
- Consistent task management API for CPU tasks and GPU tasks
    - GPU kernel language: CL (more kernel language support to come in the future)
    - CPU tasks: support for multi-dimensional task grids (similar to GPU tasks)
- Task dependencies
- Task groups
- Recursive tasks (tasks creating other tasks)
- Efficient resource management
    - Signaling among dependent tasks
    - Kernel argument memory regions
    - Reuse of task handles
- Data movement API (synchronous and asynchronous options)
    - Asynchronous data movement is treated as an ATMI task in the task graph.
- Devices supported: AMD Carrizo and Kaveri APUs, and AMD Fiji dGPU
- Runtimes used: ROCm v1.2
