ATMI (Asynchronous Task and Memory Interface)
=============================================

Asynchronous Task and Memory Interface, or ATMI, is a runtime framework for efficient task management in heterogeneous
CPU-GPU systems. It provides a consistent API to create and launch tasks from both CPUs and GPUs (integrated and discrete). 
In ATMI, the high-level task configurations can be simply described by using a few predefined C-style structures before launching the tasks.
The task configuration includes the task dimensions and granularity, dependencies to other tasks, data requirements and so on. The ATMI runtime, based on the overall task
graph and individual task configurations, will perform task scheduling and memory management that is optimal for the underlying platform. ATMI provides a rich and flexible
user interface so that the end user can relinquish scheduling to the runtime (default behavior) or take full control of scheduling and
mapping, if desired. The target audience for ATMI is application programmers or middleware developers for high-level languages.

## Deprecation Notice ##
ATMI is not being released as part of AMD ROCm software after ROCm 5.6. Previously released branches are still available for reference. 
ATMI will henceforth be maintained as a separate research project at https://github.com/AMDResearch/atmi.

## ATMI (v0.7) Feature List
- ATMI-RT: host runtime library to manage tasks
- ATMI-DEVRT: device runtime library for managing task enqueue from the GPU to both the CPU and other GPUs in the system
- ATMI-C (experimental): Declarative task-based programming model using C language extensions (works only with GCC)
- A comprehensive machine model for CPUs, integrated GPU (APU) and discrete GPU systems.
- Consistent task management API for CPU tasks and GPU tasks
    - GPU kernel language: Any language (e.g, CL and HIP) that can be compiled to AMD GCN code objects
    - CPU tasks: support for multi-dimensional task grids (similar to GPU tasks)
- Task dependencies
- Task groups
    - (Experimental) Dependencies between task groups
- Recursive tasks (tasks creating other tasks)
- Efficient resource management
    - Low latency signaling among dependent tasks
    - Kernel argument memory regions
    - Reuse of task handles
    - Efficient task to work queue scheduling
- Data movement API (synchronous and asynchronous options)
    - Asynchronous data movement is treated as an ATMI task in the task graph
- Interoperability with HSA/ROCm: Map between ATMI handles and ROCm data structures for expert programmers
- Supported platforms: all devices that are supported by [ROCm](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm) are supported by ATMI
- Supported runtime: ROCm v2.1+
- Several miscellaneous code refactoring and bug fixes
