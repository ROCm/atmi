This sample uses a BRIG generated by cloc and dispatches to the GPU using the Obsedian runtime

#Pre req - Install development version of libelf
sudo apt-get install libelf-dev

Step 1: Set HSBEPATH to HSAIL_LLVM_backend/bin.
Step 2: ./cloc vector_copy.cl
Step 3: Set all the paths according to your workspace in Makefile (Paths to the Obsidian runtime). Run make all (This will also compile vector_copy.cl
to vector_copy.brig)
Step 4: Run "bash run.sh"
