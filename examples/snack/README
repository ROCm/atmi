These directories provide examples of how to write, compile, link, and execute
GPU accelerated applications using SNACK functions.

How to use these examples. 

Copy the example directory to a place that you can update.
cd to that directory and run the command 

./buildrun.sh

These buildrun scripts are very short. They set necessary environment variables,
compile the .cl files with cloc, compile and link the main application with 
a gcc compiler, and then execute the main application. 

SNACK is an acronym for 

  SNACK = Simple No Api Compiled Kernels.

SNACK uses cloc to generate an object file from a cl file containing GPU kernel code. 
cloc is a command line utility written in bash for generating many types of compiled kernels. 
Run cloc -h to see all the cool stuff you can do with cloc or read the 
buildrun.sh scripts. 

This is NOT OpenCL.  Snack application do not use the OpenCL API.
However, the kernel language uses the same subset of c that OpenCL uses.
We preserve the file type .cl for interoperability with OpenCL.
cloc will also generate the necessary header file for each .cl file. 
so that your c or c++ application will call the kernel function correctly. 

Link this object with your application so you your application can call the functions directly. 
All the examples show the command to compile and link a main application with these object files. 
This is the best way to understand the libraries and runtime that snack requires. 
There are no snack specific runtimes or libraries.  Snack uses HSA only.
A few examples use some additional utility libraries. 

Calling a SNACK function requires you provide ONE additional argument called lparm.
This argument provides the global and local run dimensions to execute your kernel. 
This argument is a simple structure that can be initialized with the SNK_INIT_LPARM 
string macro provided in the generated header. 

Here are two examples to fill in the lparm structure.

SNK_INIT_LPARM(lparm,strlength)

SNK_INIT_LPARM(lparm,strlength)
lparm->ndim=2;
lparm->gdims[0]=B.width;
lparm->gdims[1]=A.height;
lparm->ldims[0]=BLOCK_SIZE;
lparm->ldims[1]=BLOCK_SIZE;

Please see the fortran example for how to set launch_params with Fortran.

The sample helloworld shows how to use the same .cl file for c, c++, and Fortran.
